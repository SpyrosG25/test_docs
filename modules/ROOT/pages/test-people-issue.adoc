= test_people_issue_53.py : exception and logic breakdown

When started the file tests/data/people/ar53/people_authority.csv and its first row is loaded. These values are saved into a dict whose keys are the header values of tests/data/people_authority_0.csv. There is one-to-one correspondence between these files.

Then the values under \`person` are extracted and a copy is saved under key \`parent_data`. Since this happens early on in the node, before any process has been performed, I assume these will be used as reference. 

The main logic is performed by the _AddPerson_ configurable, which parses the values in the dict and for each key maps it to CRM using the cromulent package.

The only cromulent objects that were accessed during the run are in the end serialized to json-lds.
