= Meeting notes:

* Components pipeline/\\__init__.py
* GraphExecutor
* There is not a single place where data is cleaned before entering the pipeline
    ** Bits of code that perform some cleaning can be found here and there.
* Class helpers:
    ** If nodes/projects share a common functionality e.g make_la_person then this can most likely be moved into a helper function and be injected into the class.
    ** So the same functionality needs to be shared but there is not parent/child relation between the components.
* KeyManagement:
    ** The process goes like this :
        *** A csv row gets translated to a json entry
        *** Name,location,age
        *** John,heraklion,27
+
[disc]
            **** Is translated to:
+
*** {
+
[disc]
        **** Name: John
        **** Location: Heraklion
        **** age: 27
+
*** }
** Key Management allows as to reconstruct the above dict to some more useful in the pipeline (merge entries to array and stuff)
* Thread per node
* 1,2,3 run sequentially
* Group_repeating
* Prefixes -> same number , same entry
* Nest flat dictionary
* Serializer node

* Model parent (crm_vocab.tsv ok to use)
* Vocab.register_instance (classified_as) (instance unique no ident)
    ** For classification and things that
* Top level objects (no merge, problem id)
* Chain of uris
* JsonValueWriter
    ** rewrite
