= Bonobo Services

The project makes heavy usage of a type of dependency injection named "`services`". These refer to callable code and python objects, which are registered/created upon initialization and are subsequently shared by all objects in the pipeline. They represent values in a dictionary.

For example, all files under data/common/ correspond to a service with the same name in the runtime.

See people.py for examples.
